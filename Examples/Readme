  SMARTGPU2 ARDUINO V6.0 EXAMPLES

/Those examples help the user to communicate any SMARTGPU2 BOARD with the arduino board, be sure to check pinout while mounting the SMARTGPU2 or mounting SMARTSHIELD!

/For the very first time of using SMARTGPU2, program the bare arduino board without the SMARTGPU2 mounted,next times the SMARTGPU2/SMARTSHIELD could be mounted without
 problem while the arduino is being programmed. (this is to protect the I/O pins of the arduino to avoid an Output be connected to an Output and cause wrong voltage loading).

/Open and compile any example, once it's loaded into the arduino, just press the external RESET switch on the arduino to run the example.

/IMPORTANT!!!! Some examples require pre-loaded images or text files into the microSD card, those files are inside each folder of sketch that need images or text files.

/**************************************************************/
Be sure to place first the SMARTGPU2 library, the entire folder(SMARTGPU2)
place it in the arduino root:

arduino\arduino\libraries\SMARTGPU2

restart arduino to recognize the library and enjoy!

be sure to check out all the SMARTGPU2 examples 100% ready to compile
