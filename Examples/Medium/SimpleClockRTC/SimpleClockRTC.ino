 IMPORTANT : This Example is created for the Arduino 1.0 Software IDE
 
 THIS DEMO REQUIRES A 32.768Khz CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR MOUNTED/SOLDERED ON THE SMARTGPU2 BOARD
 ON THE PADS LABELED AS "OSC32K", IF THE CRYSTAL ISN'T MOUNTED, THIS DEMO WON'T WORK
 
 THIS DEMO USES THE CURRENT RTC TIME TO UPDATE THE CLOCK HANDS
